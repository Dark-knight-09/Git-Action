## Types of Deployment Strategies


1. **Big Bang Deployment**: This strategy involves deploying the new version of the software to all servers or instances at once. It is typically used for smaller applications or when the impact of downtime is minimal. However, it carries a higher risk as any issues or failures affect the entire system simultaneously and cause a lot of downtime.

2. **Rolling Deployment**: In this strategy, new versions of the software are gradually rolled out to a subset of servers or instances, while the remaining servers continue to serve the previous version. This allows for a smooth transition and minimizes downtime.

3. **Blue-Green Deployment**: In this strategy, two identical environments, referred to as "blue" and "green", are set up. The current version of the software runs in one environment (e.g., blue), while the new version is deployed to the other environment (e.g., green). Once the new version is tested and verified, traffic is switched from the blue environment to the green environment.

4. **Canary Deployment**: This strategy involves deploying a new version of the software to a small subset of users or servers, often referred to as the "canary group". The performance and stability of the new version are monitored closely, and if no issues are detected, the deployment is gradually expanded to a larger audience.

5. **Rollback Deployment**: In case of any issues or failures with a new deployment, a rollback strategy allows for reverting back to the previous version of the software. This ensures that the system can quickly recover from any unexpected problems.

6. **Immutable Deployment**: In this strategy, new versions of the software are deployed by creating entirely new instances or containers, rather than updating existing ones. This approach ensures that each deployment is isolated and can be easily rolled back if needed.

7. **A/B Testing**: This strategy involves deploying multiple versions of the software to different groups of users or servers, and then comparing the performance and user feedback to determine which version is more effective. It is often used to test new features or changes before a full deployment.

usually a combination of these strategies is used to achieve the desired deployment goals. 
For example, 
1. a blue-green deployment may be used for major version updates, 
2. canary deployments may be used for smaller incremental changes.
3. rollback and A/B testing strategies can be employed as needed to ensure a smooth and successful deployment process.
